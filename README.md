How to use:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
First argument must be information which you want  to see for example resopcinfo -r which
will print about ram, but you also can do something like this resopcinfo -rco which will 
print information about ram, cpu and  os But remember you cannot use the same argument  
multiple times otherwise you will get an error.                                                                                                                                                            

If you want to print information without colors use  resopcinfo  --no-color  as second or third argument (not first).                                                                                                                      
And if you want to clear screen before printing information  just write  resopcinfo --clear-screen.
